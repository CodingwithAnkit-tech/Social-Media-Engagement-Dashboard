# 🔹 Internship Context

This project was completed as Task 1 of my one-month Data Analytics Internship at CodeC Technologies.
The objective of this task was to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world dataset and demonstrate practical skills in:
- Data analysis and preprocessing
- Interactive dashboard creation using Power BI
- Extracting actionable business insights from social media data
- This task helped strengthen my understanding of data-driven decision-making and visualization techniques.
